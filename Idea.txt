After analyzing the code from the LLMProject repository, I found several relevant files and their contents that can be aligned with the proposed functionalities for your productivity app. Here are some key insights and suggestions based on the existing code:

Email and Notification System: The services/gmail.js file contains code for sending emails, which can be used to send daily summaries of tasks to users. You can enhance this by allowing users to mark tasks as completed directly from the email.

Task Management and Tracking: The services/notion.js file shows integration with Notion, which can be used for managing and tracking tasks. You can expand this to categorize tasks based on their urgency (daily, weekly, monthly) and automate the task rescheduling process.

Birthday Reminders: Implement a function to fetch birthdays from a source (like Google Calendar or contacts) and integrate it with the notification system. This is partially implemented in app.js as fetchBirthdaysFromGoogleCalendar but needs completion.

Progress Tracking for Reading: For tracking reading progress, you can use the utils/pdfUtils.js for handling PDFs. Consider implementing a feature where users can set reading goals (e.g., number of pages) and the app tracks their progress.

Motivation and Learning Content: Use services/openai.js to fetch motivational quotes or interesting facts. You can also use this for suggesting daily learning topics or articles. The data/systemTopics.js and data/journalTopics.js files already contain some content that can be used for daily learning suggestions.

Reward System: Implement a reward system to motivate users. This can include virtual rewards or points for completing tasks, reading goals, or staying off social media.

Social Media Replacement Features: Add features like mood tracking, journaling, or a daily challenge to engage users and provide alternatives to social media usage.

Customizable User Interface: Allow users to customize the app's interface to prioritize features they find most useful, such as task lists, reading progress, or learning topics.

Integration with External APIs: Your app already has integrations with several APIs (like Tenor for GIFs, YouTube for videos). You can expand this to include other APIs for diverse content, like NASA for space facts or news APIs for daily news summaries.

User Feedback and Improvement Suggestions: Implement a feature where users can provide feedback on their accomplishments and areas of improvement. Use this feedback to offer personalized suggestions and improvements.

These suggestions aim to enhance user engagement and productivity, making the app a comprehensive tool for daily personal and professional development.
